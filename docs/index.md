# ZeroShot UI — Docs

This site contains documentation for the ZeroShot component library.

- View interactive component previews (Storybook) at: [/storybook/](./storybook/)

## Quickstart

Locally build Storybook into the docs public folder and run the docs dev server:

```bash
npm run build:storybook:docs
npm run docs:dev
```

Then visit the dev site and open `/storybook/` to view interactive previews.

See the `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml` workflow for a manual-only deploy to the `gh-pages` branch.
